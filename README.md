# MultiAgent-Pong

This is a ML Project done to demonstrate Multi Agent Competitive , Cooperative and Transition behaviors in Trained AI using common games, in this case PONG.
- We used the OpenAI pong environment to demonstrate the behaviour.
- The project is based on the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08779
- The agents are trained using DQN using PyTorch framework.
